    "The output-sensitive algorithm from the line segment intersection lecture uses the **plane sweep technique**, which is a general technique suitable to solving various problems in computational geometry.\n",
    "It simulates a **sweep line** to pass through the input elements, while maintaining the status at the current sweep line position and the event points that are yet to be visited by the sweep line.\n",

    "Such points should thus come first in the event queue order (see [1, p. 24]).\n",

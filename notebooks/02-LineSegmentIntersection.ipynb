    "Considering that for most practical puporses only few intersections occur in relation to the number of input segments, an output-sensitive algorithm that depends on the number of intersections is of interest.\n",
    "We've already seen examples for such algorithms: Gift Wrapping and Chan's Hull for the convex hull problem.\n",
    "The output-sensitive algorithm from the line segment intersection lecture uses the **plane sweep technique**, which is a general technique suitable to solving various problems in computational geometry.\n",
    "It simulates a **sweep line** to pass through the input elements while maintaining the status at the current sweep line position and the event points that are yet to be visited by the sweep line.\n",
    "The versatility of this technique partly comes from the fact that new event points can be computed on the fly during the course of the sweep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the **status structure** consists of all line segments currently intersected by the sweep line, while the **event queue** contains line segment endpoints and previously computed intersection points.\n",

    "Such points should thus come first in the event queue order (see \\[1, p. 24\\]).\n",
    "Moreover, we deal with the degenerate case of event points having the same $y$-coordinate by prioritising smaller $x$-coordinates, i.e. the corresponding events are handled from left to right.\n",
    "Note that, in order to somewhat compensate for the inaccuracy of floating-point arithmetic, we use comparisons involving a small epsilon value throughout this notebook.\n",

    "At first, the status structure is initialised as an empty binary tree, while the event queue is initialised as a binary tree containing all line segment endpoints as keys.\n",
    "The event queue also stores a value for each key that consists of the list of line segments having this key as their upper endpoint.\n",
    "That's why the event queue's type is <tt>BinaryTreeDict</tt> as opposed to the simple <tt>BinaryTree</tt> type used for the status structure, which doesn't support values.\n",
    "\n",
    "During each step of the actual sweep, an event point is popped from the queue along with the segments having it as their upper endpoint.\n",
    "A subsequent search in the status structure yields all other line segments containing the event point, which are promptly deleted from the status structure.\n",
    "Next, those segments having the event point as their upper endpoint or containing it in their interior are inserted into the status structure.\n",
    "This is done according to the new status structure order induced by the event point, as implemented in the comparator above.\n",
    "Note that segments containing the event point in their interior are deleted and re-inserted, so their order in the status structure is reversed.\n",
    "(Except for the relative order of overlapping line segments, which doesn't matter as stated above.)\n",
    "Hence, there's no need for a separate swap procedure and the degenerate case of more than 2 line segments intersecting in one point is handled elegantly (see \\[1, p. 26\\]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the segments that have become adjacent in the status structure due to the deletions and (re-)insertions are checked for intersections.\n",
    "If there now aren't any line segments in the status structure that contain the event point, the left and right status neighbours of the event point are adjacent.\n",
    "Otherwise, the left status neighbour is adjacent to the leftmost containing segment in the status structure, whereas the right status neighbour is adjacent to the rightmost such segment.\n",
    "In both cases, an intersection point of two newly adjacent segments is added to the event queue if it hasn't already been visited by the sweep line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the event point is reported along with all its containing line segments.\n",
    "Points with at least two containing segments are intersection points."

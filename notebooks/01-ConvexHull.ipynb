    "The final convex hull algorithm from the lecture is **Chan's Hull**, which combines Graham Scan and Gift Wrapping.\n",
    "It first separates the *n* input points into *n/m* sets of size *m* and computes the convex hulls of these sets using Graham Scan.\n",
    "A suitable value for the parameter *m* with *h <= m <= h²* is found by **repeatedly squaring** as shown in the lecture (see also [2, p. 19]).\n",
    "Let's call the convex hulls resulting from this process *mini hulls*.\n",
    "Next the Gift Wrapping technique is applied, but with the help of the mini hulls we can reduce the number of candidates and thus don't need to search through all *n* points.\n",
    "That's possible because the mini hulls are convex polygons and their vertices are returned in cyclic order by Graham Scan, enabling us to find the best candidate from a mini hull, i.e. the vertex with the largest induced angle, in O(log(*m*)) time through \"a variant of binary search\" (see [2, p. 17] for a more detailed statement of this claim, though it also omits the proof and how the search exactly works).\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard binary search is only applicable for monotone sequences, whereas we have to search for a vertex that is better than both its neighbours.\n",
    "For so-called **unimodal sequences**, which consist of a monotonely ascending and a monotonely decreasing part, [Ternary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_search) can be used.\n",
    "If the first mini hull vertex is the worst one, the sequence of induced angles is indeed unimodal:\n",
    "Starting with the smallest angle, it goes up until the angle of the best vertex is reached, then it goes down until the end.\n",
    "Unfortunately, Ternary search isn't sufficient here either because the arbitrary cyclic order of mini hull vertices might result in one monotone part being split in two, i.e. the sequence of induced angles can be comprised of three parts with alternating monotonicity (e.g. up, then down, then up) and is therefore not necessarily unimodal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not discuss the implementation of our binary search variant further.\n",
    "The interested reader can study its core logic in the following *ChanWrapper.get_candidates()* method.\n",
    "To make things even more complicated, handling the degenerate case of collinear points is quite intricate, since it can cause two neighbouring vertices to induce the same angle in the sequence.\n",
    "Examining such two vertices doesn't tell us the direction in which the sequence is ascending, so the binary search indexes have to be adjusted in that case.\n",
    "If necessary, this is done in the *ChanWrapper._calculate_indexes()* method.\n",
    "Note that, to keep the code cleaner, our candidate search implementation might return more than one candidate, but it's limited to at most four candidates, which is an asymptotically constant amount per mini hull."
